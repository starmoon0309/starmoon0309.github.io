I am now a third-year Ph.D. student at School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Wei Gao (高伟)](https://gaowei262.github.io/). I focus on learning-based visual media compression, including image compression, video compression, point cloud compression and multi-modal compression. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
