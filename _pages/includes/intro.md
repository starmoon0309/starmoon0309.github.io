I am now a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [School of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen Graduate School](https://www.pkusz.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am supervised by Prof. [Wei Gao (高伟)](https://gaowei262.github.io/) in [National Engineering Laboratory for Video Technology – Shenzhen Division](https://web.pkusz.edu.cn/ldm/). I focus on learning-based media compression, including image compression, video compression, point cloud compression and multi-modal compression. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
